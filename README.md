### Welcome to my Repo
- I'm a university instructor of Latin & Classical Literature, and I'm excited to see where I can go with technology. 
- Concept & design are the elements of programming I most enjoy, but you don't end up teaching dead languages because you're not willing to overcome some extreme obstacles. I enjoy challenges, and love the feeling of accomplishing difficult tasks. 

- Poison ivy removal, baking bread, reading & making big plans for my yard are some of the things I enjoy most. 
- Want to contact me? Send me an email at lisaellison@gmail.com.
