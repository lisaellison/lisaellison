## Thanks for your interest in my GitHub page! 
### Not much to see here at the moment. I completed a full-stack bootcamp in 2020 and am exploring Digital Humanities project ideas.
<!-- ### Welcome to my Repository
- I'm a university instructor of ancient Greek & Latin languages & literatures, and I'm excited to integrate programming and the humanities. 
- Concept & design are the elements of programming I most enjoy, but you don't end up teaching dead languages because you're not willing to overcome some extreme obstacles. I enjoy challenges, and love the feeling of accomplishing difficult tasks. 

- Poison ivy removal, baking bread, reading & making big plans for my yard are some of the things I enjoy most. 
- Want to contact me? Send me an email at lisaellison@gmail.com.
